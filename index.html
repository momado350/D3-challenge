          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The Relationship between Household income (Median) and Obesity Percentage, shows that there is a negative Correlation,
          While Household income increase the Obesity Percentage decrease. State of west Virginia recorded the highest obesity rate 
          35.9%, with Median income of $41,059. and Colorado state recorded the Lowest Obesity percentage 21.3% and median Income of 
          $61,303  a year.(one of my team member once told me that Weed is Good!).
          Age (Median) and Obesity shows no strong correlation, However Poverty Percentage shows positive correlation with Obesity 
          percentage. </p>

          <p>Again The Household Income shows negative correlation with Smoker Percentage,And Age Median shows no strng correlation
          with Smokers Percentage, While there is very Strong Correlation between Poverty percentage and Smokers Percentage. </p>

          <p>Now we can see that there is a pattern, we have Negative correlation between Household income and Lacks Healthcare Percentage
          , No correlation between Between Age Median and Lacks Healthcare percentage, And positive correlation between Poverty Percentage
          and Lacks Healthcare percentage.</p>
          <p><strong>Conclution:</strong> We can conclude that Age dose not affect Obese (%), Smokes (%) and Lacks Healthcare (%).
          Household Income (Median) has negative effect on Obese (%), Smokes (%) and Lacks Healthcare (%), And Finaly In Poverty (%) has Positive effect on 
          Obese (%), Smokes (%) and Lacks Healthcare (%)
Lacks Healthcare  .</p>
